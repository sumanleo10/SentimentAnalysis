# SentimentAnalysis
Sentimental analysis is a hot topic of research. Use of electronic media is increasing day by day.
Time is money or even more valuable than money therefore instead of spending times in reading
and figuring out the positivity or negativity of text we can use automated techniques for
sentiment analysis. Sentiment analysis is used in opinion mining. The applications of sentiment
analysis are broad and powerful. The ability to extract insights from social data is a practice that
is being widely adopted by organisations across the world. Shifts in sentiment on social media
have been shown to correlate with shifts in the stock market.
Example – Analyzing a product based on it’s review and comments.

In our work, we have used a supervised learning technique to tag the reviews of a movie using
the IMDB dataset present in NLTK corpora. We have used Naive Bayes classifier on movie
reviews and made a Pilot Model Naive Bayes with TFIDF feature vectors on sarcastic reviews.
Various stemmers and lemmatizers have also been used.
